                <h3>50 Years of Gaming History, by Revenue Stream (1970-2020)</h3>
                <p>View a more detailed version of the above by <a href="#">clicking here</a></p>
                <p>Every year it feels like the gaming industry sees the same stories—record sales, unfathomable market
                    reach, and questions of how much higher the market can go.</p>
                <p>We’re already far past the point of gaming being the <a href="#">biggest earning</a> media sector,
                    with an estimated $165 billion revenue generated in 2020.</p>
                <p>But as our graphic above helps illustrate, it’s important to break down shifting growth within the
                    market. Research from <a href="#">Pelham Smithers</a> shows that while the tidal wave of gaming has
                    only continued to swell, the driving factors have shifted over the course of gaming history.</p>
                <h3>1970–1983: The Pre-Crash Era</h3>
                <p>At first, there was Atari.</p>
                <p>Early prototypes of video games were developed in labs in the 1960s, but it was Atari’s release of
                    <em>Pong</em> in 1972 that
                    helped to kickstart the industry.
                </p>
                <p>The arcade table-tennis game was a sensation, drawing in consumers eager to play and companies that
                    started to produce
                    their own knock-off versions. Likewise, it was Atari that sold a home console version of
                    <em>Pong</em> in 1975, and eventually
                    its own Atari 2600 home console in 1977, which would become the first console to sell more than a
                    million units.
                </p>
                <p>In short order, the <a href="#">arcade market</a> began to plateau. After dwindling due to a glut of
                    <em>Pong</em> clones, the release of <em>Space
                        Invaders</em> in 1978 reinvigorated the market.
                </p>
                <p>Arcade machines started to be installed everywhere, and new franchises like <em>Pac-Man</em> and
                    <em>Donkey Kong</em>
                    drove further
                    growth. By 1982, arcades were already generating <a href="#">more money</a> than both the pop music
                    industry and the
                    box office.
                </p>
                <h3>1985-2000: The Tech Advancement Race</h3>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, the gaming industry grew too quickly to maintain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eager to capitalize on a growing home console market, Atari licensed extremely high budget ports of
                    <em>Pac-Man</em> and a game
                    adaptation of <em>E.T. the Extra Terrestrial</em>. They were rushed to market, released in poor
                    quality, and
                    cost the company
                    millions in returns and more in brand damage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As other companies also looked to capitalize on the market, many other poor attempts at games and
                    consoles caused a
                    downturn across the industry. At the same time, personal computers were becoming the new flavor of
                    gaming, especially
                    with the release of the Commodore 64 in 1982.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was a sign of what was to define this era of gaming history: a technological race. In the coming
                    years, Nintendo
                    would release the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) <a href="#">home console</a> in 1985 (released
                    in Japan as the
                    Famicom),
                    prioritizing high quality games and consistent marketing to recapture the wary market.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the backs of games like <em>Duck Hunt</em>, <em>Excitebike</em>, and the introduction of Mario in
                    <em>Super Mario Bros</em>,
                    the massive success
                    of the NES revived the console market.

                <p>
                    Nintendo looked to continue its dominance in the field, with the release of the Game Boy handheld
                    and the Super Nintendo
                    Entertainment System. At the same time, other competitors stepped in to beat them at their own game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1988, arcade company Sega entered the fray with the Sega Mega Drive console (released as the
                    Genesis in North
                    America) and then later the Game Gear handheld, putting its marketing emphasis on processing power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Electronics maker Sony released the PlayStation in 1994, which used CD-ROMs instead of cartridges to
                    enhance storage
                    capacity for individual games. It became the first console in history to sell more than <b>100
                        million</b> units, and the focus
                    on software formats would carry on with the PlayStation 2 (DVDs) and PlayStation 3 (Blu-rays).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even Microsoft recognized the importance of gaming on PCs and developed the DirectX API to assist in
                    game programming.
                    That “X” branding would make its way to the company’s entry into the console market, the Xbox.
                </p>
                <h3>2001–Present: The Online Boom</h3>
                <p>
                    It was the rise of the internet and mobile, however, that grew the <a href="#">gaming industry</a>
                    from tens of billions to hundreds of
                    billions in revenue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A primer was the viability of subscription and freemium services. In 2001, Microsoft launched the
                    Xbox Live online
                    gaming platform for a monthly subscription fee, giving players access to multiplayer matchmaking and
                    voice chat
                    services, quickly becoming a must-have for consumers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meanwhile on PCs, Blizzard was tapping into the Massive Multiplayer Online (MMO) subscription market
                    with the 2004
                    release of <em>World of Warcraft</em>, which saw a peak of more than <b>14 million</b> monthly
                    paying subscribers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All the while, companies saw a future in mobile gaming that they were struggling to tap into.
                    Nintendo continued to hold
                    onto the handheld market with updated Game Boy consoles, and Nokia and BlackBerry tried their hands
                    at integrating game
                    apps into their phones.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But it was Apple’s iPhone that solidified the transition of gaming to a <a href="#">mobile
                        platform</a>. The company’s release of the
                    App Store for its smartphones (followed closely by Google’s own store for Android devices) paved the
                    way for app
                    developers to create free, paid, and pay-per-feature games catered to a mass market.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, everyone has their eyes on that growing <b>$85 billion</b> mobile slice of the gaming market,
                    and game companies are
                    starting to heavily consolidate.

                    Console makers like Microsoft and Sony are launching cloud-based subscription services even while
                    they continue to
                    <a href="#">develop new consoles</a>. Meanwhile, Amazon and Google are launching their own services
                    that work on multiple devices,
                    mobile included.

                    After seeing the success that games like <em><a href="#">Pokémon Go</a></em> had on
                    smartphones—reaching more than <b>$1 billion</b> in yearly
                    revenue—and <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em>’s record breaking haul of <b>$1 billion</b> in just three
                    days,
                    companies are targeting as much
                    of the market as they can.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And with the proliferation of smartphones, social media games, and streaming services, they’re on
                    the right track. There
                    are more than 2.7 billion gamers worldwide in 2020, and how they choose to spend their money will
                    continue to shape
                    gaming history as we know it.
